## 1 Main R packages

The main R packages used for DNA methylation data preprocessing are:

*   `Minfi`<sup>1</sup>
*   `ChAMP`<sup>2,3</sup>
*   `RnBeads`<sup>4,5</sup>

## 2 Data import

IDAT files obtained from Illumina’s iScan are directly imported into R as raw data using `minfi`’s<sup>1,6</sup> read function. The corresponding sample sheet and, if necessary, a specific array manifest file are also read in. Data are then converted into an `RGChannelSet` containing the raw intensities in the green and red channels as well as the intensities of internal control probes.

## 3 Quality control

### 3.1 Initial quality control

For quality control in `minfi`, the `RGChannelSet` is converted into a `MethylSet` to generate methylated and unmethylated signals from the red and green intensities according to the microarray’s probe design. This does not perform any normalization. Then, the following quality control plots are produced:

*   Log median intensity in methylated and unmethylated channels via `getMeth()` and `getQC()`
*   Densities: `densityPlot()`
*   Density bean plots: `densitybeanPlot()`

### 3.2 Quality assessment using control probes

`Minfi` can produce several control probes plots for quality assessment: 

*   The `plotQC()`function provides a simple quality control plot using the log median intensity in both the methylated and unmethylated channels where 'good' sampels should cluster together, while 'failed' samples tend to separate and have lower median intensities 
*   Control probes plot for bisulfite conversion (for probe type I and II): `controlStripPlot()`
*   All these plots can be generated along with further informative control probes plots in one step using the function `qcReport()`

In addition, quality checks as implemented in Illumina’s BeadArray Controls Reporter<sup>7</sup> can be performed with an R package `ewastools` published by Heiss _et al._<sup>8</sup> which evaluates 17 control metrics calculated from control probes. The following metrics are calculated and reported back in numbers and figures can also be generated (most of them are also shown in a different style in `minfi`’s qcReport):

*   Restoration
*   Staining green
*   Staining red
*   Extension green
*   Extension red
*   Hybridization high/medium
*   Hybridization medium/low
*   Target removal 1
*   Target removal 2
*   Bisulfite conversion I green
*   Bisulfite conversion I red
*   Bisulfite conversion II
*   Specificity I green
*   Specificity I red
*   Specificity II
*   Non-polymorphic green
*   Non-polymorphic red

`HumMethQCReport`<sup>9</sup> (currently not available for EPIC) generates the following figures: 

*   Barplots of Illumina internal controls
*   Intensity at high and low Beta-values
*   Percentage of non-detected CpGs
*   Average detection p-value

Furthermore, control probes plots as provided by Illumina GenomeStudio<sup>10</sup> can be obtained via the `plotCtrl()` function of the R package `ENmix`<sup>11</sup>: 
  
*   Bisulfite conversion I red and green
*   Bisulfite conversion II red and green
*   Extension red and green
*   Hybridization red and green
*   Negative red and green
*   Non-polymorphic red and green
*   Specificity I red and green
*   Specificity II red and green
*   Staining red and green
*   Target removal red and green
*   Norm A red and green
*   Norm C red and green
*   Norm G red and green
*   Norm T red and green
*   Norm ACGT red and green

An alternative version of these plots can be generated with `shinyMethyl`<sup>12</sup>, an interactive tool providing a convinient way of identifying potentially problematic samples. The package also provides the possibility to visually inspect the distribution of covariates across slides (currently not working for EPIC).

### 3.3 Identification of sample mismatches

The `Minfi`, `RnBeads`, `ENmix` and `ewastools` packages further provide the option to identify potential sample mix-ups using high-frequency SNP probes. For the same purpose of detecting possible mismatches, the sex of the sample donor can be determined based on the methylation signal at sex chromosomes. Sample contamination can be assessed with `ewastools`.

### 3.4 Quality assessment based on all cg probes used for downstream analyses

A `RatioSet` object can be generated to store actual methylation values instead of the methylated and unmethylated signals (a copy number matrix can also be obtained if required). The `RatioSet` is generated with the function `ratioConvert()`. Subsequently, both a Beta- and a M-value matrix are obtained from the `RatioSet` via `getBeta()` and `getM()`. Alternatively, the methylation value matrices can also be obtained from an `RGChannelset` or `MethylSet`.

The following plots for quality control are produced from both the Beta- and M-value matrix: 

*   Sample-wise density plots colored by phenotype of interest 
*   Group-wise density plots (CpG-wise mean per group)
*   Principal component analysis (PCA) using all CpGs, colored by phenotype of interest
*   Multidimensional scaling (MDS) using all CpGs, colored by phenotype of interest
*   Hierarchical clusterings (complete, average, median, wardD, centroid and single) performed on Euclidean distances, including a heatmap and dendrograms, colored by phenotype of interest
*   PCA, MDS and clusterings as above, but colored by all additional covariates to be assessed, in particular, technical (or biological) variables that could potentially lead to batch effects
*   Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) plots examining associations between principal components and all technical and biological covariates available
*   Age distribution per phenotype of interest (overlayed histograms or density plots)

## 4 Probe Filtering

Probes meeting the following criteria are removed from all samples:

*   Detection p-values > 0.01 in ≥ 1 sample or more stringent thresholds as recently suggested<sup>12,13</sup>
*   Bead count < 3 in ≥ 5% of the samples
*   Non-cg probes
*   Ambiguous genomic locations (cross-hybridization) as provided by Zhou _et al._<sup>14</sup> (not to be removed for epigenetic clock analyses)
*   SNPs of the corresponding population provided by Zhou _et al._<sup>14</sup> (not to be removed for epigenetic clock analyses)
*   Sex chromosomes (unless they are needed for specific analyses, and also not to be removed for epigenetic clock analyses)
*   Optionally: Non-variable probes (only if required for specific reasons)

## 5 Normalization

Bisulfite conversion of DNA and other experimental steps introduce assay variability and batch effects. Technical variation should be reduced as much as possible. Illumina 450K and EPIC BeadChips use two fluorescent dyes (Cy3-green and Cy5-red) and two different probe types (Infinium I and Infinium II), leading to technical biases which should be corrected. Background noise also needs to be removed. To this aim, negative control probes and out-of-band (OOB) probes are present on Illumina’s arrays. 

Many different normalization methods are available and the normalization method to be applied depends on each dataset, the research question and the downstream analyses to be performed. Usually, suitable normalization methods are performed (on either Beta- or M-values as required by the method), and their results are compared to each other. Then, the quality assessment steps listed in section 3.4 are repeated to help to choose the most appropriate method(s) for the specific dataset and research question. Individual steps from different normalization methods can also be combined and performed sequentially to obtain optimal results. 

For example, normalization methods that perform (only) specific tasks such as dye bias, probe type bias or background correction may be followed by normalization methods that remove technical variance across arrays. Several normalization methods combine the correction of the above-mentioned technical biases and subsequent global normalization including both within- and across-sample normalization to remove unwanted technical variance. Across-sample normalization may not always be suitable<sup>15</sup>. A few methods that only apply within-sample normalization are available such as for example PBC and ssNoob. These normalization methods are particularly useful for datasets where the global distribution of DNA methylation levels is expected to differ significantly across samples<sup>15</sup> and for projects where the normalization of single samples needs to be reproducible independently from the rest of the samples, or where new additional samples will be added to the dataset over time<sup>6</sup>.

*   **ssNoob<sup>6</sup>** (<ins>s</ins>inge-<ins>s</ins>ample <ins>N</ins>ormal-exponential <ins>o</ins>ut-<ins>o</ins>f-<ins>b</ins>and, available in `minfi`): \

In our experience, both BMIQ and Funnorm together with ENmix's probe type correction often give good results with successful reduction of technical variation and correction for background and probe type bias. Dye-bias normalization can be achieved with Noob, for example.

The mentioned methods provide appropriate results for analyses of global DNA methylation and variability patterns, rank-based approaches, site- and region-based analysis of differential mean and variability of DNA methylation, and epigenetic clock analyses. Probe type bias correction is particularly important for the assessment of global DNA methylation patterns, clusterings, rank-based approaches and region-based analyses. The best possible removal of all technical variation is crucial under all circumstances, but even more critical for analyses of biological variation such as epigenetic drift and differential variability. 

SWAN works well when no global shifts in DNA methylation are expected while BMIQ is better suited when significant global differences are present between the phenotypes of interest (see above). This can be the case when comparing normal samples with samples of a cancer type in which global hypomethylation occurs, for example. The quantro method<sup>15</sup> can aid the decision by assessing such global differences.

Quantile and quantile stratified normalization are less well suited for DNA methylation analyses and can introduce additional bias. Illumina’s GenomeStudio normalization method does not reduce technical variation<sup>27,28</sup>. It can even introduce additional variability<sup>29</sup>. FunNorm and BMIQ can sometimes also lead to biased distributions, in particular for DNA methylation M-values. SWAN, BMIQ and PBC have been shown to outperform other methods<sup>27,29,30</sup>. PBC can lead to discontinuities in probe type II density distributions under certain circumstances<sup>30</sup> and might thus not always be the best suitable approach. All principally suitable methods should be applied to the data, and their results should be assessed carefully (see above).

## 6 Batch-effect correction

Useful methods to detect batch effects and biological confounders are **Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA)** implemented in the `sva` package<sup>31</sup> and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)<sup>32</sup>** available in `ChAMP`, as well as the `pcrplot()` function of `ENMix` which uses a linear regression approach but might work less well than SVD for categorical variables. These methods assess the impact of significant components of variation present in a dataset. Unknown sources of variation can be detected, and importantly, the contribution of all available technical and biological covariates can and should be assessed. One 450K or EPIC BeadChip accommodates multiple samples (n=12 and n=8, respectively) which can cause a batch effect associated with array ID (‘Sentrix ID’). The arrays’ position on the BeadChip (row and column, ‘Sentrix Position’) also impacts the data. If any significant batch effects or unwanted confounders are observed, the data can be corrected for these effects by the application of **ComBat<sup>33</sup>** as long as they are not directly confounded with the phenotype of interest.

ComBat is the most widely used method for batch effect correction. It is implemented in `sva`, `minfi`, `ChAMP` and `RnBeads` and usually works best on DNA methylation M-values. However, sometimes better results are achieved when applying ComBat to Beta-values instead. Thus, it can be useful to perform ComBat on both M-values and Beta-values and assess the results with the help of SVA/SVD and the quality assessment plots described in section 3.4 to compare them to each other.

## 7 Subpopulation correction

When working with composite samples such as whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or brain tissue, cell composition differences across samples may need to be corrected. The most common reference-based method to assess and correct for subpopulation differences is **Houseman’s algorithm<sup>34</sup>** in combination with a blood cell reference dataset of the six most common white blood cell types<sup>35</sup> available in `minfi`, `ChAMP` and `RnBeads`. A newer blood cell reference was published in 2018<sup>36</sup>. Here, blood cells were isolated from 31 male and six female healthy donors while for the previous reference dataset cells were obtained from six adult males.

Reference-free methods also exist<sup>37–41</sup>. The results of the correction should be assessed visually by plotting the cell type distributions per sample, mean cell type distributions per group, and by repeating the quality assessment plots that are listed in section 3.4. 

Two interesting new methods to identify the cell types driving differential DNA methylation signal in composite samples such as whole blood have recently been developed: **CellDMC** (DMC = <ins>D</ins>ifferentially <ins>M</ins>ethylated <ins>C</ins>ytosines)<sup>42</sup> and **TCA** (<ins>T</ins>ensor <ins>C</ins>omposition <ins>A</ins>nalysis)<sup>43</sup>.

## 8 Sample filtering

Based on the initial quality assessment, the control probe plots, and the visual inspection of all global plots (densities, PCA, MDS and hierarchical clusterings, see section 3.4) performed before and after each preprocessing step, samples that turn out to be outliers corresponding to multiple measurements and plots might be removed from the dataset for downstream analyses. 

To further aid the detection of potential outlier samples, the following functions and algorithms can be used: 

*   `detectOutlier()` of the R package `Lumi`
*   `outlyx()` of the R package `wateRmelon`
*   The locFDR outlier detection method as described in Hannum _et al.,_ Mol Cell, 2013<sup>44</sup>

## 9 Beta- and M-value conversion

As mentioned, some methods require Beta-values as input. M-values can be converted into Beta-values and vice versa using the following functions implemented in `RnBeads:`

```
  beta2mval <- function(betas, epsilon = 0.00001) {
    if (!is.numeric(betas)) {
      stop("invalid value for betas")
    }
    if (!(is.numeric(epsilon) && length(epsilon) == 1 && (!is.na(epsilon)))) {
      stop("invalid value for epsilon")
    }
    if (epsilon < 0 || epsilon > 0.5) {
      stop("invalid value for epsilon; expected 0 <= epsilon <= 0.5")
    }
    betas[betas < epsilon] <- epsilon
    betas[betas > (1 - epsilon)] <- 1 - epsilon
    return(log2(betas / (1 - betas)))
  }

  mval2beta <- function(mvals) {
    if (!is.numeric(mvals)) {
      stop("invalid value for mvals")
    }
    intmf<-2^(mvals)
    return(intmf/(intmf+1))
  }

```

## 10 Additional notes

M-values are used for all downstream statistical analyses such as differential mean methylation or analyses of variability and epigenetic drift. Beta-values are only used for the visualization of DNA methylation patterns.

An exception are epigenetic clocks to perform epigenetic age estimations<sup>45–48</sup> and other epigenetic predictors. Most of these methods require Beta-values as input.
